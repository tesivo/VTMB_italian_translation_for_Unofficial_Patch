Who seemed to step from shadow to shadow like through a door! Is it a Lasombra? But what is he doing here in LA? Is it about Beckett's sarcophagus? I'll better follow him around the next few nights, just to be on the safe side."

Later the new agent of the prince entered it, soon after the bouncer ran out in panic and into the sewers! I followed him all the way to Santa Monica where he then visited the smoke shop to relax."

I was still watching the place when, again, the agent of the prince arrived. Suddenly the Kindred stepped out of a shadow nearby! I hope I wasn't spotted. He took a cab back to the library."
